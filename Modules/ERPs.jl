## Estimate the mean ERPs using the arithmetic mean if `overlapping` is false
# (defaut) or the multivariate regression method explained in Congedo
# et al.(2016) if `overlapping` is true.
#
# METHODS (1) and (2)
# RETURN a mean or vector of means, one mean for each class, depending
# on the value of argument `mark`.
# `X` is the whole EEG recording of size # of samples x # of electrodes
# `wl` is the window length, i.e., the ERPs duration, in samples
# `mark` (markers) is either
#       1) a vector of integers holding the (1-based) serial number
#       of the samples where there is the stimulation for a class (trials onset)
#       2) a vector of nc integer vectors as in 1), where nc is the
#       number of classes.
#       Typically, `mark` is created from a stimulation vector using the
#       'stim2mark' function of this module.
#       If `mark` holds empty vectors, they will be ignored and the mean will
#       not be computed for those marks. The number of means therefore will
#       be equal to the number of non-empty mark vectors.
#       NB! If the mark with offset results in incomplete diagonals in the
#       toeplitz matrix required for the multivariate regression model (only if
#       `overlapping` is true), those marks will be deleted.
# NB! If `overlapping` is true, all means should be estimated at once;
# In fact, the means computed individually are different from the means
# if they are computed all at once.
# NB! For method 1) `overlapping` is automatically set to false since in this
# case the arithmetic average and the multivariate regression methods are
# equivalent, but the arithmetic average is faster and more accurate.
# NB! Requesting the multivariate regression estimator with `overlapping=true`
# if the ERPs do not overlap will make the computations slower and less accurate.
#
# OPTIONAL KEYWORD ARGUMENTS:
# `offset` is an offset for determining tha trial starting sample
#         with respect to the samples in `mark`. Can be zero, positive or negative.
#         BEWARE! If mark has been created using an offset, you won't need it here!
# `weights` can be used to obtain weighted means. It is either
#       1) a vector of non-negative real weights for the trials
#       2) a vector of nc vectors as in 1)
#       In both cases `weights` has the same dimension of `mark`.
#       If `weights=:a` is passed, adaptive weights are
#       computed as the inverse of the squared Frobenius norm of the
#       trials data, along the lines of Congedo et al. (2016).
#       By default, no weights are used.
#
# METHODS (3) (declared in EEGio.jl)
# RETURN a mean or vector of means, one mean for each class, depending
# on the value of argument `mark`.
# `o` is an EEG structure (see EEGio.jl). The fields `X` and `mark`
#   are taken from the structure.
# `overlap`, `weights` and `offset` have the same meaning of methods (1) and (2).
# If a marker vector or vector of vectors is passed as argument `mark`,
#   these markers are used to compute the mean(s). This can be used
#   to compute only the mean of one class or the means of some but not
#   classes defined by o.mark.
#   By default o.mark is used.

# EXAMPLES:
# (1)
# compute the mean only for class 1
# M=mean(X, wl, mark[1]; weights=:a)
# (2)
# compute the means for all classes
# ùêå=mean(X, wl, mark; overlapping=true, weights=:a)
# compute the means for classe 1 and 3
# ùêå=mean(X, wl, [mark[1], mark[3]]; overlapping=true, weights=:a)
# (3)
# ùêå=mean(o; overlapping=true, weights=:a)
# compute the mean only for class 1
# M=mean(o; mark=o.mark[1], weights=:a)

## Convert a vector of stimulations into a vector of vectors of markers;
# `stim` is a ns-vector of stimulations, where ns is the number of
# samples in the data `stim` is coupled with.
# `stim` holds 0 everywhere, but at the samples where a stimulation occurs,
# where it holds a POSITIVE integer coding the stimulation class.
# By default the code for stimulations must be the natural numbers
# 1, 2, 3, ... Missing values are allowed, in which case the corresponding
# vector of markers will be an empty vector.
# In this case the number of mark vectors will be equal to the highest integer
# in `stim`.
# Alternatively, you can pass a vector of integers with the code for each class
# as `code`. In this case arbitary integers can be used (even negative)
# and the number of mark vectors will be equal to the number of
# unique integers in `code`.
# If `code` is provided, the nc-vectors are arranged in the order given there,
# otherwise the first vector correspond to stimulation=1, the second to
# stimulation=2, etc.
# RETURN an nc-vector of vectors, where `nc` is the number of classes, i.e.,
# the non-zero elements in `code` or the highest integer in `stim`.
# In the vector for each class there are as many elements as stimulations for
# that class and the elements are the samples when the stimulations occurred.
# In each vector the samples are sorted in ascending order.
# The window-length `wl` must be provided in order to make sure not to include
# markers that allow the definition of trials going beyond `ns`, where `ns`
# is the number of samples in `stim`, that is,
# a marker can only point to a sample whose index is < ns-wl+offset.
# `offset` can be applied to shift the markers with respect to the stim.
# The `offset` must be provided in samples. It can be positive, to shift the
# onset of the trial forward, or negative, to shift it backward (0 by default).

## Compute adaptive weights for trials as the inverse of their squared

#       'stim2mark' function of this module.
# if `mark` is a vector and a matrix is passed as the `M` argument, then the

#       `M` in general is the mean ERP for the class and can be used

#       the `M` argument, then the estimator here above is used for all classes.

# Blind Source Separation for ERPs.
# The method here implemented is a refinement of the method presented in
# https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01078589
# BSS is solved by approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) of a set of
# (1) Fourier cospectra (induced and background activity) and
# (2) covariance matrices of ERP means.
# `Xerp` is a tall data matrix used to extract ERP means for (2)
# `sensor` is a vector of electrode labels (string)
# `Xcospectra` is a tall data matrix used to extract cospectra for (1)
#       This may be the same as `Xerp`, however in general `Xerp` is the
#       data passed through a narrower band-pass filter (e.g., 1-16 Hz)
# `markERP` is a Vector of vectors of Integers with the markers
#       for extracting the trials used for (2). There are exactly as many
#       Vectors as ERP classes to be included in the AJD set.
# `markCospectra` is a vector of vectors of Integers with the markers
#       for extracting epochs used for (1). This may be equal t `markERP`,
#       but it may hold a larger set of markers. Also note that `markCospectra`
#       does not have to hold the same number of vectors as ``markERP` since
#       here all trials are used to estimate the cospectra.
# `sr` is the sampling rate of the data in `Xerp` and `Xcospectra`
# `wl` is the window length of the data in `Xerp` and `Xcospectra`
#       This is the length of the trials used both as window length for
#       Fourier co-spectra computations and for computing ERPs.
# KEYWORD ARGUMENTS :
# if `erpOverlap` is true the multivariate regression method is used to compute
#       ERP means. If false (default) the arithmetic mean is used
# if `erpWeights` = `:a`, the adaptive weighting is used for computing
#       the ERP means. It defaults to `:none` (equal weighting).
#       For this and the previous argument see `Mean` in this module.
# `erpCovEst` is the covariance matrix estimation method used for the ERP means.
#       Possible choices are (defaulting to :nrtme) :
#       `:scm` = sample covariance matrix
#       `lse` = Ledoit and Wolf linear shrinkage
#       `:tme` = Tyler's M-estimator
#       `:nrtme` normalized regularized M-estimator of Zhang (see Tyler module)
# `cospectraBandPass` is the band-pass region in which cospectra are estimated.
#       The actual number of cospectra estimated depends on the Fourier
#       frequency resolution sr/wl. The default is `(1, 32)` (Hz).
#       For noisy data starting at 2Hz and/or stopping at 28 to 28 Hz
#       can give better results.
# `cospectraTapering` is the tapering window used for the FFT.
#       See the `cospectra` function in FourierAnalysis.jl
# `whiteningeVar` is the explained variance retained in the pre-whitening step.
#       Pre-whitening determines the number of sources to be estimated and
#       is a crucial hyper-parameter for this and similar BSS procedures.
#       If you pass a real number ‚àà(0, 1] the dimension will be adjusted to the
#       minimum integer guranteeing to explain at least the requested variance.
#       You can enforce e specific dimension passing it as an integer.
#       The default (0.999) is an appropriate choice in general
# `AJDalgorithm` is the AJD algorithm to be employed.
#       See Diagonalizations.jl for the options. The suggested choices are
#       :QNLogLike (default) and :LogLike.
# `AJDmaxIter` is the maximum number of iterations allowed for the AJD algorithm.
# If `verbose` is true (default), information on the convergence reached at
#       each iteration by all iterative algorithms employed is shown in the REPL.
