# This format has been conceived for easily sharing EEG data in Python and 
# Julia. Each file is understood as a separate recording. Data consist of two
# files. They have the same name and extensions `npz` and `yml` (this file).

# The `npz` file typically holds the EEG data matrix, a real matrix of 
# dimension num. of samples x num. of electrodes and a vector of integer with
# the tags for stimulations, with as many entries as number of samples. The 
# tags are 0 (zero) for no stimulation and then employs the natural numbers 
# (1, 2,...) for different stimulation classes.

# The `yml` file holds all meta-data info of the recording in `yml` format. 
# It holds two fields and four dictionaries:

# FIELDS:
#
# - paradigm: (string) the experimental paradigm, e.g., P300, MI, ... 
#             for Brain Computer Interfaces experiments
#
# - formatversion: (version) version of this metadata specification

# DICTIONARIES:
#
# - acquisition: (dictionary)
#
#   - filter: (string) filter setting of the EEG acquisition machine, 
#             specifying the type and specification. Ex: "Band-pass digital 
#             filter (0.01-70Hz)"
#   - ground: (string) location of the sensor used as ground. Ex: "Fpz"
#   - reference: (string) location of the sensor used as reference for the 
#                recording. Ex: "A1"
#   - hardware: (string) the commercial name and producer of the the EEG 
#               acquisition machine. Ex: "actiCHamp, Brain Products GmbH 
#               (Germany), DC amplifiers"
#   - software: (string) software used for acquiring and storing the data. 
#               Ex: OpenViBE, INRIA (France)
#   - samplingrate:(int) sampling rate. Ex: 128
#   - sensors: (array-like of strings) location of the sensors, excluding 
#              ground and reference.
#   - sensortype: (string) type, material and product name of electrodes. 
#                 Ex: Ag/AgCl, Braincap, Brain Products GmbH (Germany)
#
# - documentation: (dictionary)
#
#   - description: (string) link to a file or website describing the dataset
#   - doi: (string) digital object identifier of the dataset's documentation
#   - repository:  (string) link to the online repository where the data can 
#                  be downloaded
#
# - id: (dictionary)
#   
#   - database: (string) name of the database
#
# - stim: (dictionary)
#
#   - labels: (dictionary) dictionary with the labels and code of the 
#             stimulations
#       - nclasses: (int) number of classes for the stimulations
#       - offset: (int) offset, given in number of samples, with respect to 
#                 stimulation samples, defining the beginning of trials
#       - windowlength: (int) size of the window, given in number of sample, 
#                       defining the duration of trials
